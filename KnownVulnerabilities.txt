DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS
=====================

1. SQL Injection - Login Email
   Endpoint: POST /auth/login
   Parameter: email (JSON body)
   File: backend/api/models/User.php -> findByEmailUnsafe()
   Description: The email value is directly concatenated into a SQL query
   without parameterized statements. An attacker can inject SQL via the
   email field to bypass authentication or extract data.
   Example: email = ' OR 1=1 --

2. SQL Injection - Wine Detail (ID)
   Endpoint: GET /wines/:id
   Parameter: id (URL path)
   File: backend/api/models/Wine.php -> getByIdUnsafe()
   Description: The wine ID is directly concatenated into a SQL query.
   The route accepts non-numeric values, allowing SQL injection.
   Example: GET /wines/1 UNION SELECT * FROM users--

3. Reflected XSS - Login Email
   Endpoint: POST /auth/login
   Parameter: email (JSON body)
   File: backend/api/controllers/AuthController.php -> login()
   Description: On failed login, the error message includes the raw email
   address: "Login failed for <email>. Please check your credentials."
   The email is not HTML-encoded, so injecting HTML/JavaScript in the
   email field will be reflected in the API response.
   Example: email = <script>alert(1)</script>

4. Reflected XSS - Wine Search
   Endpoint: GET /wines?search=<payload>
   Parameter: search (query string)
   File: backend/api/controllers/WineController.php -> index()
   Frontend: frontend/app/wines/WinesCatalog.js
   Description: The search query is returned in the API response as-is
   in a "message" field. The frontend renders this message using
   dangerouslySetInnerHTML, enabling XSS.
   Example: search=<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>

5. Stored XSS - User Name (Account Page)
   Endpoint: PUT /auth/profile
   Parameter: name (JSON body)
   File: frontend/components/Navbar.js
   Description: The user's name is stored without sanitization and
   rendered in the navigation bar using dangerouslySetInnerHTML
   ("Hi, <name>"). An attacker can set their name to a script payload
   and it will execute on every page load.
   Example: name = <img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>

6. Stored XSS - Shipping Name (Checkout)
   Endpoint: POST /orders
   Parameter: shipping_address.name (JSON body)
   Frontend: frontend/app/orders/[id]/page.js
   Description: The shipping name entered during checkout is stored in
   the database and rendered on the order detail page using
   dangerouslySetInnerHTML. Anyone viewing the order details will
   have the XSS payload executed.
   Example: name = <script>alert('XSS')</script>

7. JWT "none" Algorithm Accepted
   Endpoint: Any authenticated endpoint
   Header: Authorization: Bearer <token>
   File: backend/api/config/jwt.php -> decode()
   Description: The JWT decoder checks the "alg" field in the token
   header. If alg is "none", it skips signature verification entirely
   and accepts the token payload as valid. An attacker can forge tokens
   by setting alg=none and providing arbitrary payload data.
   Example: Header={"alg":"none","typ":"JWT"}, Payload={"user_id":1,"email":"admin@example.com","exp":9999999999}

8. JWT Signature Not Verified
   Endpoint: Any authenticated endpoint
   Header: Authorization: Bearer <token>
   File: backend/api/config/jwt.php -> decode()
   Description: Even for HS256 tokens, when the signature doesn't match,
   the code only logs a warning but still accepts the token. An attacker
   can modify the payload of any JWT token (e.g., change user_id) without
   needing to know the secret key.

9. Directory Listing
   URL: https://taintedport.com/files/
   URL: https://api.taintedport.com/files/
   File: docker/nginx.conf
   Description: Nginx is configured with autoindex enabled on /files/,
   which maps to the backend source directory. This exposes all PHP
   source code, the SQLite database file, and configuration files
   including the JWT secret. An attacker can download the database
   and extract user credentials.

10. CSRF on Checkout
    Endpoint: POST /orders
    File: backend/api/index.php (CORS config)
    Description: The CORS policy reflects any Origin header back with
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true. Combined with the lack of
    CSRF tokens, an attacker can create a malicious page that submits
    orders on behalf of authenticated users. If the user has items in
    their cart and visits the attacker's page, the order will be placed
    automatically.


BUSINESS LOGIC VULNERABILITIES
==============================

#  VULNERABILITY                   LOCATION                                CWE         SEVERITY
-- -------------------------------- ---------------------------------------- ----------  --------
11 BOLA (IDOR) on Order Details    GET /orders/:id                         CWE-639     High
12 BOLA / Mass Assignment          PUT /auth/profile (user_id param)       CWE-639     High
13 Price Manipulation              POST /cart/add (price param)            CWE-472     High
14 Broken Access Control on 2FA    POST /auth/2fa/disable (user_id param)  CWE-639     High
15 Discount Code Bypass            POST /orders (discount_code/percent)    CWE-472     High


11. BOLA (IDOR) on Order Details
    Endpoint: GET /orders/:id
    File: backend/api/models/Order.php -> getById()
    Description: The order detail endpoint does not verify that the
    authenticated user owns the order. Any authenticated user can view
    any order by guessing or enumerating order IDs.

12. BOLA / Mass Assignment on Profile Update
    Endpoint: PUT /auth/profile
    Parameter: user_id (JSON body)
    File: backend/api/controllers/AuthController.php -> updateProfile()
    Description: The profile update endpoint accepts an optional user_id
    parameter. If provided, it updates that user's name instead of the
    authenticated user's name. An attacker can modify any user's profile.

13. Price Manipulation on Cart
    Endpoint: POST /cart/add
    Parameter: price (JSON body)
    File: backend/api/controllers/CartController.php -> add()
    File: backend/api/models/Cart.php -> addItem()
    Description: The cart add endpoint accepts an optional price field.
    If provided, it updates the wine's price in the database to the
    client-supplied value before adding to cart. An attacker can set
    any wine's price to 0.01 and buy it at that price.

14. Broken Access Control on 2FA Disable
    Endpoint: POST /auth/2fa/disable
    Parameter: user_id (JSON body)
    File: backend/api/controllers/AuthController.php -> disable2fa()
    Description: The 2FA disable endpoint accepts an optional user_id
    parameter. If provided, it disables 2FA for that user instead of
    the authenticated user. An attacker can disable any user's 2FA
    by providing their user_id (only needs their own valid password).

15. Discount Code Bypass
    Endpoint: POST /orders
    Parameters: discount_code, discount_percent (JSON body)
    File: backend/api/controllers/OrderController.php -> create()
    File: backend/api/models/Order.php -> create()
    Description: The checkout endpoint accepts discount_code and
    discount_percent fields. Any non-empty discount_code is accepted
    as valid, and discount_percent is applied directly without validation.
    An attacker can send discount_percent=100 for a free order, or
    even negative values for credit.
